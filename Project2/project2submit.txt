Where in the code the passive connection timeout is set (provide a script name and line number):
	Not implemented
Calls in the code to the server (provide a class name and function, or URL used for debugging):
	Class: Cloud
		Function: createUserXml
		Function: loadGame
		Class: CatalogAdapter
		Function: saveGame

Notes:
	-Transitioning between activities is only partially working. A user can correctly signal another user that they have started
		a game, but then nothing further works.
	-Passive timeout is not implemented.
	-Loss of server connection is not handled
	-It was intended that each user be allowed one active game. Deactivating and deleting games is not implemented. This means
		that when a user that has already started a game logs in, he is automatically transferred to the 'WaitingForGuess' 
		activity.
